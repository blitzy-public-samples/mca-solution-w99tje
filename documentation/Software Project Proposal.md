4. 20% ($131,120) after successful user acceptance testing
5. 20% ($131,120) upon project completion and final delivery

### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could potentially impact the budget:

1. **OCR Accuracy Improvements**: If the initial OCR solution doesn't meet the required accuracy levels, additional investment in more advanced OCR technology or machine learning models may be necessary.

2. **Scalability Challenges**: As the system scales to handle increasing volumes of applications, additional cloud resources may be required, potentially increasing infrastructure costs.

3. **Security and Compliance**: Changes in data protection regulations or additional security requirements may necessitate extra development work or the implementation of additional security measures.

4. **Integration Complexities**: Unforeseen challenges in integrating with Dollar Funding's existing systems could require additional development time and resources.

5. **Data Migration**: If historical data needs to be migrated into the new system, this could add to the project scope and cost.

To manage these potential risks:

- We've included a 10% contingency in the budget to cover unforeseen expenses.
- Regular project status meetings will be held to identify and address any issues early.
- The modular design of the system allows for flexibility in adjusting or enhancing specific components without impacting the entire project.
- We will work closely with Dollar Funding's IT and security teams to ensure all integration and compliance requirements are met from the outset.
- Clear communication channels will be established to quickly address and resolve any budget-related concerns as they arise.

By carefully monitoring these considerations and maintaining open communication with Dollar Funding, we aim to deliver the project within the proposed budget while meeting all specified requirements.
