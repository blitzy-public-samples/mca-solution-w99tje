```

The system is built on a modern, scalable cloud infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure high availability, performance, and security. Key technologies and services include:

- Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL for the primary database
- Amazon S3 for document storage
- AWS Textract for OCR and data extraction
- Amazon EC2 for application hosting
- Amazon VPC for network security
- AWS IAM for access control
- Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging

The system is designed to handle the entire lifecycle of an MCA application, from initial email receipt to final processing and notification. It incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms for document classification and state-of-the-art OCR technology to handle various document qualities, including handwritten applications.

Security and compliance are paramount, with the system adhering to financial industry regulations and data protection standards such as GDPR and CCPA. End-to-end encryption, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit logging ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive financial data.

The RESTful API and web-based user interface provide flexible access options for Dollar Funding staff and potential integration with existing systems. The webhook notification system enables real-time updates to relevant stakeholders, enhancing the overall efficiency of the MCA application process.

By automating the majority of the application processing tasks, this system aims to reduce Dollar Funding's reliance on manual data entry by 93%, processing applications faster and more accurately while providing a scalable solution for future growth.

## SYSTEM DESIGN

### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The MCA application processing system will utilize the following programming languages, chosen for their suitability to specific components and overall system requirements:

| Language | Purpose | Justification |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Python 3.9+ | Backend services, API development, data processing | - Excellent for rapid development<br>- Rich ecosystem of libraries for data processing and machine learning<br>- Strong support for asynchronous programming<br>- AWS Lambda compatibility |

### DATABASE DESIGN

The system will use Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL as the primary database. The database schema is designed to efficiently store and manage MCA application data:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    APPLICATION ||--o{ DOCUMENT : contains
    APPLICATION ||--o{ MERCHANT : has
    APPLICATION ||--o{ OWNER : has
    APPLICATION ||--o{ FUNDING : has
    APPLICATION {
        uuid application_id PK
        uuid email_id FK
        enum status
        timestamp received_date
        timestamp processed_date
    }
    EMAIL {
        uuid email_id PK
        string sender
        string subject
        text body
        timestamp received_date
    }
    DOCUMENT {
        uuid document_id PK
        uuid application_id FK
        enum type
        string storage_url
        timestamp upload_date
    }
    MERCHANT {
        uuid merchant_id PK
        uuid application_id FK
        string legal_name
        string dba_name
        string federal_tax_id
        string address
        string industry
        decimal annual_revenue
    }
    OWNER {
        uuid owner_id PK
        uuid application_id FK
        string name
        string ssn
        string address
        date date_of_birth
        decimal ownership_percentage
    }
    FUNDING {
        uuid funding_id PK
        uuid application_id FK
        decimal amount_requested
        string use_of_funds
    }
    WEBHOOK {
        uuid webhook_id PK
        string url
        enum event_type
        boolean is_active
    }
```

Key considerations for the database design:

1. Use of UUIDs as primary keys for better distribution and scalability
2. Normalization to reduce data redundancy
3. Appropriate use of foreign keys to maintain data integrity
4. Indexing on frequently queried fields for improved performance
5. Use of enumerated types for status and document type fields

### API DESIGN

The system will expose a RESTful API for client integration and internal service communication. The API will follow OpenAPI Specification 3.0 and implement the following key endpoints:

1. Application Management
   - `POST /applications`: Submit a new application
   - `GET /applications`: List applications with filtering and pagination
   - `GET /applications/{id}`: Retrieve a specific application
   - `PATCH /applications/{id}`: Update application status

2. Document Management
   - `GET /applications/{id}/documents`: List documents for an application
   - `GET /documents/{id}`: Retrieve a specific document
   - `POST /documents`: Upload a new document

3. Webhook Management
   - `POST /webhooks`: Register a new webhook
   - `GET /webhooks`: List registered webhooks
   - `DELETE /webhooks/{id}`: Remove a webhook

4. User Management
   - `POST /users`: Create a new user
   - `GET /users`: List users
   - `PATCH /users/{id}`: Update user details

API Security Measures:
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for web client access

### USER INTERFACE DESIGN

The web-based user interface will be developed using React and follow a responsive design approach. Key components of the UI include:

1. Dashboard
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Dashboard] --> B[Application Statistics]
    A --> C[Recent Applications]
    A --> D[Notifications]
    A --> E[Quick Actions]
```

2. Application Management

    A --> C[Sorting Options]
    A --> D[Pagination]
    A --> E[Application Details]
    E --> F[Document Viewer]
    E --> G[Merchant Information]
    E --> H[Owner Information]
    E --> I[Funding Details]
```

3. Webhook Configuration
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Webhook Management] --> B[Add Webhook]
    A --> C[Edit Webhook]
    A --> D[Delete Webhook]
    A --> E[Test Webhook]
```

4. User Management
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Management] --> B[User List]
    A --> C[Add User]
    A --> D[Edit User]
    A --> E[User Roles]
```

UI Design Principles:
- Intuitive navigation with a clear hierarchy
- Consistent color scheme and typography aligned with Dollar Funding's branding
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet devices
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Real-time updates using WebSocket connections for critical information

The user interface will be designed to minimize the learning curve for data entry specialists transitioning from the manual process, while providing advanced features for IT administrators and executives to manage the system effectively.
